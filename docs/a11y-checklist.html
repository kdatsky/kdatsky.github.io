                            <p>Through an audit of over 120 key pages across 5 BCLC’s websites and 1 mobile app, it was identified that there were <em>significant accessibility issues</em>. This wasn’t a surprise for the organization as the products weren’t designed with accessibility as a priority. If issues were caught earlier on, before going live, the organization could’ve saved on time, money, and resources to fix the inaccessibility problems.</p>

                            <p>How do you embed accessibility into your technical work when you don’t have the lived experience? For BCLC’s UX Team, this meant re-looking at their design process. As the lead designer, I defined a standardized set of accessibility principles for the team to ensure are implemented during their design process that accommodates their players, including those facing situational challenges, as well as visual, physical, hearing, cognitive or learning impairments. The following is one facet the UX team implemented to produce accessible experiences.</p>

It’s faster and more cost-effective to resolve accessibility issues in the beginning during the design phase of a product or feature. Defining a standardized set of principles the UX team can implement into their design process provides transparency and accountability to each other, across different product teams, as well as saves time, energy, and money by having products designed with accessibility in mind the first time.</p>
